## A Mermaid or Two

There is a mermaid in Fig.\ \ref{fig:kaptain}

\scale=50%

```{.mermaid caption="Kaptain!\label{fig:kaptain}" filename=kaptain-mermaid loc=images format=png width=1200}
graph TD
    A[Christmas] -->|Get money| B(Go shopping)
    B --> C{Let me think}
    C -->|One| D[Laptop]
    C -->|Two| E[iPhone]
    C -->|Three| F[fa:fa-car Car]
```

And here is another (vanishing in the transition to PDF):

\scale=75%

```mermaid

    commit
    branch develop
    checkout develop
    commit
    commit
    checkout main
    merge develop
    commit
    commit
```

Back into the ocean.
